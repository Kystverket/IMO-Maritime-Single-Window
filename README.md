## Prerequisites
Make sure to clone the repository on your computer. 
Then download and install the following
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Database setup
Follow the guide below to install postgres on your machine.

Once completed and you have a server up and running, [run the following script to create and populate your database](https://github.com/Fundator/IMO-Maritime-Single-Window/blob/master/IMOMaritimeSingleWindow/Server/SqlScripts/Create_and_populate_DB.sql)

After running the script, copy the file named "appsettings.default.json" in your Server folder, paste it into the same location and rename the copy to "appsettings.json".
